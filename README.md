# openfactura
OpenFactura is the historical reference to a GPL contribution that implement the algorithms for NSF7, NSF7 is part of a RND (normative resolution of directory), of the National Tax Service of the Bolivian Government

This software was used to train new developers in the implementation of NFS7 in the Python programming language.

The software was published in January 2008 in Sourceforge under GPL license.

Today there is a new RND with a different regulation and few taxpayers use NFS7 still.
